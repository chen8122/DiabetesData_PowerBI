**KPI and Patient History Visulization**
Question: individuals with diabetes are more likely to develop hypertension or the opposite?

Insights: 
-Most patients started diagnosised diabetes around the age of 40 to 60: `DM Age = demographic[Age] - demographic[Diabetes Duration]`.  
[CDC](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes-age-of-onset): Adults aged 45â€“64 receive the majority of new diabetes diagnoses in U.S.
-There are 50 patients among 77 who labeled either DM or HTN: `DM||HTN Patients = IF(demographic[Group] = "DM" || demographic[HTN] = "HTN", 1, 0)`.  
-56% developed hypertension after diagnosed diabetes: 'DD to HTN? = IF(demographic[Diabetes Duration]- RELATED(patient_history[htn_years])>0, "Diabetes->Hypertension", IF(demographic[Diabetes Duration]- RELATED(patient_history[htn_years])<0, "Hypertension->Diabetes","Same Year"))'  
[NIH](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29556093/): Diabetes patients experience increased peripheral artery resistance caused by vascular remodeling and increased body fluid volume associated with insulin resistance
**Patient History: Alcohol and Tabacco Use**
Question: Will diabetes patients tend to change their Alcohol and Tabacco use habit?

Based on their reported previous use and current use, I categorized them into four groups: never stop using, never use, start using and stop using.

Insights:
-Majority patients never changed their alcohol habit.
-Remarkable propotion of patients who listened to their doctor and stop using tobacco.
-More patients in control group who drinking. While the propotion of smoking are quite similiar in DM and control gourps.  
**Effects on Lipid Profile**
**Question**: Are patients' lipid profile differ much in DM and control group? Further more, do they differ much in mild cognitive declined group(failed <=2/10 cognitive tests) and cognitive declined group(failed >2/10 cognitive tests)?!

**Doubts**: Based on the research, diabetes patients tend to have higher triglycerides and LDL level and lower HDL. And abonormal lipid profile usually associate with an increased risk of cognitive decline. Higher Triglycerides and LDL, lower HDL are expected in DM and cognitive declined group. However, the results displayed here did not align with my anticipated outcome. 
**Problem Solving**: My team suspected, maybe patients were using medicine to control their particular medical condition. That's why the distingtion was not clear. So I loaded \_additional data source\_ and extracted these patients' medication usage information. The following two dashboards are done to reveal the hidden information beyond the origional dataset.  
**Medicine Intake**  
There are four categories: diabetes, hypertension and heart related, lipid, and cognitive. Most patients are taking lipid and diabetes related medicine. 11 of them are using insulin.
