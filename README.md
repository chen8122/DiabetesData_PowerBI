# DiabetesData_PowerBI
## About the Dataset  
This dataset was collected as part of a prospective observational study to evaluate the effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on cerebral vasoregulation, perfusion and functional outcomes, measured by blood flow responses to hypocapnia and hypercapnia, Valsalva maneuver, head-up tilt, and sit-to-stand test. The dataset comprises of observations from 69 diabetic and control participants (aged 55 to 75 years) with continuous measurements of cerebral blood flow using transcranial Doppler and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory parameters, balance, walking, laboratory and retinopathy measures at baseline, and 41 subjects who completed the two-years of follow-up.  
After modeling the original dataset into 11 relational tables, I focused on demographic KPI analysis, patients' medical history, medicine intake and the effects on lipid profile and cognitive decline. 
## My Responsibility  
My role in the project was to lead the data modeling and data cleaning efforts using **Power BI Query Editor**. I categorized the dataset into different categories such as demographics, medical history, medication, labs, blood pressure, MRI, ophthalmology, walking, and cognitive tests. My analysis work focused on demographic and patients' medical history, resulting in several interactive dashboards visualizing .... Insights were gained regarding the relationships between diabetes and hypertension, changes in alcohol and tobacco use among diabetes patients, and the effects of diabetes and cognitive decline on lipid profiles. Additionally, the impact of medication intake on lipid profiles and cognitive decline was examined.  
The findings of the project revealed interesting patterns and insights, challenging initial expectations in some cases. Further exploration was conducted to understand the potential role of medication in influencing health outcomes. The dashboards provided a comprehensive overview of the dataset and facilitated data-driven decision-making.  
**Data modeling** improved performance, organization, and collaboration within the team. It allowed for flexibility in changing data source, adding new calculations, groups, bins, columns or tables without disrupting the entire dataset.

**Data Cleaning**  constituted a significant portion of the workload. I employed various techniques, including removing duplicates, filtering rows, merging data, transforming data types, mapping descriptions to scaled numbers, recalculating outliers, and replacing values based on column constraints. Advanced techniques such as using Power Query's functional language "M" were also utilized to pivot and transform abnormal values.     
- Example1: Mapping description texts to scaled numbers; Create new relational tables (One-to-Many Cardinality):

## Dashboard: KPI and Patient History Visulization

**Question**: Are individuals with diabetes more likely to develop hypertension or vice versa?  
**Insights**:   
-Most patients were diagnosed with diabetes between the ages of 40 and 60:  
`DM Age = demographic[Age] - demographic[Diabetes Duration]`  
According to the [CDC](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes-age-of-onset#age-at-diagnosis), adults aged 45â€“64 receive the majority of new diabetes diagnoses in the U.S.  
-Out of 77 patients, 50 have been labeled with either DM or HTN:  
`DM||HTN Patients = IF(demographic[Group] = "DM" || demographic[HTN] = "HTN", 1, 0)`     
-56% of the patients developed hypertension after being diagnosed with diabetes:    
'DD to HTN? = IF(demographic[Diabetes Duration]- RELATED(patient_history[htn_years])>0, "Diabetes->Hypertension", IF(demographic[Diabetes Duration]- RELATED(patient_history[htn_years])<0, "Hypertension->Diabetes","Same Year"))'    
Research from the [NIH](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29556093/) suggests that diabetes patients experience increased peripheral artery resistance caused by vascular remodeling and increased body fluid volume associated with insulin resistance.   

## Dashboard: Patient History - Alcohol and Tabacco Use

**Question**: Do diabetes patients tend to change their alcohol and tobacco use habits?  
Based on their reported previous use and current use, the patients were categorized into four groups: never stopped using, never used, started using, and stopped using.    
![image](https://github.com/chen8122/DiabetesData_PowerBI/assets/9794705/96380358-21ec-4259-86cc-4b94259db0ed)

**Insights**:  
-The majority of patients never changed their alcohol consumption habits.  
-A significant proportion of patients listened to their doctors and stopped using tobacco.  
-There are more patients in the control group who drink alcohol, while the proportion of smokers is similar between the DM and control groups.  

## Dashboard: Effects on Lipid Profile

**Question**: Do patients' lipid profiles differ significantly between the DM and control groups? Furthermore, do they differ significantly between the mild cognitive decline group (failed <=2/10 cognitive tests) and the cognitive decline group (failed >2/10 cognitive tests)?  
![image](https://github.com/chen8122/DiabetesData_PowerBI/assets/9794705/e92c25a3-f5e4-4617-a3c1-eac23fbd0248)  
**Doubts**: Based on research, diabetes patients tend to have higher triglyceride and LDL levels and lower HDL levels, and an abnormal lipid profile is usually associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline. Therefore, it was expected to observe higher triglycerides and LDL levels and lower HDL levels in both the DM and cognitive decline groups. However, the results displayed here did not align with the anticipated outcome.    
**Problem Solving**: To investigate the potential reasons for the unclear distinction, my team suspected that patients might be using medication to control their specific medical conditions, which could have influenced the lipid profile results. As a result, I /_loaded an additional data source/_ and extracted the medication usage information for these patients. The following two dashboards were created to reveal hidden information beyond the original dataset.    

## Dashboard: Medicine Intake

**Question**: Did medication intake mislead the lipid profile performance in diabetes patients and patients with cognitive decline?     
**Insights**:
-There are four medication categories: diabetes, hypertension and heart-related, lipid, and cognitive. Most patients are taking lipid and diabetes-related medicine, and 11 of them are using insulin.   
-Almost all diabetes patients are taking medication for diabetes, nearly all hyperlipidemia patients are taking lipid medication, and all hypertension patients are taking medication for hypertension and heart-related conditions.  
-Almost half of the patients are taking medication for both diabetes and lipid control, while 65% are taking medication for hypertension and heart-related conditions.  
-Among the patients who failed the most cognitive tests (cognitive scores == 4 or 5), only one of them did not take any medication. One patient even took seven different kinds of medication.

## Dashboard: Medicine Effect on Lipid Profile and Cognitive Decline  
![image](https://github.com/chen8122/DiabetesData_PowerBI/assets/9794705/97d436aa-1e6d-444d-9b2e-5ae0ebfc1502)  
**Question**: Does medication play a negative role in cognitive decline? Should patients avoid taking lipid control medication?  
**Insights**:    
-Group(CognitiveScore==0): Most of them do not use any lipid control medication. Only one patient had slightly abnormal HDL levels, while the rest of the lipid profile was normal.  
-Group(CognitiveScore==5): All of them are taking lipid control medication, with one patient showing abnormal LDL levels and four patients having slightly abnormal HDL levels.    
-More than half of the patients who take lipid medication are in the cognitive decline group, while only 26% of those who do not take any medication are in the cognitive decline group.  
-86% of the patients with cognitive decline have been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and are required to take lipid control medication.  
There are ongoing debates in academia and the industry about the effects of lipid medication on cognitive decline. Reference 1: [Effect of Combined Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Therapies on Cognitive Function](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crp/2020/1484357/) and 2: [Harvard Medical School: do Statins increase the risk of dementia?](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-statins-increase-the-risk-of-dementia). The suggestions they offer are somewhat similar to the recommendation I provide: listen to the doctor's advice and follow prescribed medication regimens.
